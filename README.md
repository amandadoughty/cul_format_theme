= Pearson Grid course format

This is a setting within the culcourse course format to turn on a
different course display. Pearson are advocating a particular course
design that is intended to lead a student through the course material
in a structured way.

== Course design

The Pearson Grid course format expects a specific course structure to
display correctly.

Each section title should be quite short to fit into the course home
page grid layout. The typical title will be "Week n".

Within a section, representing a week of content, use a label with no
indent to give a topic title. Within a topic, a label indented once to
the right is used to split the activities into the prepare, practice
and apply, and consolidate areas. Finally each activity needs to be
indented twice to the right within their relative areas.
